Tools used:
Sonarlint
Coverage
Pylint

During this week's assignment, I had to use coverage and sonarlint to analyze the test file (TestTriangle.py). I noticed
that before using the test I would have underlining(warnings) done by sonarlint stating that there are spacing errors or naming errors.
This would not cause much error but make code harder to read. After going thru the warnings I was able to fix the spacing making it cleaner.
However, I was not able to get a percentage coverage of my code. I did run solarlint a few times but no report or log was printed.
